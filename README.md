# Chahasy
GUI for a home automation system

Experiment to create a simple GUI for a home automation system using Node.js, MQTT, Bootstrap and Ractive

You need to install Mosca (npm install mosca -g)  and then run startMosca.

Once Mosca is running connect your browser to port 8080 of the Mosca server (e.g.: http://localhost:8080/ if mosca is running on localhost)

Bootstrap takes automatically care of responsive design as can be seen in the screenshots:
