# Chahasy
GUI for a home automation system

Experiment to create a simple GUI for a home automation system using Node.js, MQTT, Bootstrap and Ractive

## Usage
```javascript
node server.js
```

Once Aedes is running connect your browser to port 8080 of the Aedes server (e.g.: http://localhost:8080/ if Aedes is running on localhost)

Bootstrap takes automatically care of responsive design as can be seen in the screenshots:
